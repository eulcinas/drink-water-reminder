# Water Reminder App

As the AI started to play an important part in todays development and daily task I decided to try ant make a simple application using only ChatGPT. The goal was to utilise ChatGPT's capabilities by going through detailed plan and step by step try to achieve a desired application which creates a table (reminder) to drink water during set working hours. 
This app helps you track your daily water intake by generating reminders for you to drink water throughout the day. You can set your desired amount of water to drink, as well as the time range in which you'd like to receive reminders. The app will then generate reminders at regular intervals throughout that time range, with the amount of water you should drink at each reminder.
